Reflection
In this workshop, I have learnt how to use the linkage, and more important, I did understood the concept of copy constructor very deeply.
For the first time, my big issue was that I did not know how the event time start work. So I read the code from main.cpp very very carefully to understand it. Then I realized that I need to use the global variable which was g_sysClock, because that variable was the time start of the event. I did go to Seneca ICT website to take a look again at the linkage and I used the extern keyword for the g_sysClock so that I could use this variable at my Event.h and Event.cpp. Then my output was perfect then I changed to part 2. At this part, all you need to know is to understand the concept of copy constructor and why we need to use that, as well as how to create a dynamic memory and destroy the memory after use. When I see line Event copy(currentEvent); I know that I need to create a copy constructor and the line after that I need to create a copy assignment. I definitely need to create a destructor because that is a rule of 3. After all my project run perfectly.
The different between internal and external is that internal lives within the lifetime of the current module. The external variableâ€™s purpose is that you can use that variable globally or within your modules. So within your modules, external variable will have only 1 address while internal variables will have different address. Static variable will live within the lifetime of the module. It was really useful because I used it for my counter ( static int counter). If I only use int counter, my counter will automatically return to 0 whenever I call the display() function.
